# Let-s-Play-ABCD
Let's Play ABCD is played on a 4x4 grid, with lettered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either A or B. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same alphabet collide while moving, they merge into a tile with the value of the next alphabet. The game's objective is to create a tile with the alphabet K.
